# Simple Shell Project :shell:
A simple UNIX command interpreter written as part of the low-level programming and algorithm track during my study ALX-SE.

## Description :speech_balloon:
this is a simple UNIX command language interpreter that reads command from either a standard input or a file and interpretes them.
# Technologies
* Scripts written in Bash 5.0.17(1)
* C files are compiled using `gcc 9.4.0`
* C files are written according to the C89 standard
* Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
* All files are written in C programming language.
## Usage

To invoke **hsh**, compile all `.c` files in the repository and run the resulting executable:

```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh

./hsh
**hsh** can be invoked both interactively and non-interactively. If **hsh** is invoked with standard input not connected to a terminal, it reads and executes received commands in order.
